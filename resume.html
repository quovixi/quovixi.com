            <p>I joined <a href="https://tito.io/home" target="_blank">Tito</a> in 2018 as customer experience lead, having been an early customer myself. Within two years, I advanced to the leadership team, taking on responsibilities across product operations, customer support, and sales and marketing. I’ve managed the product team since 2021, overseeing strategy, processes, and the delivery of our events-focused software suite that's processed over $1b in ticket sales, and leading a team of engineers.</p>
            <p>I set direction, prioritise projects, and handle spec development, backlog triage, feature testing, and documentation. I often also take a lead on product-adjacent initiatives, contributing to company strategy (including pricing, recruitment, procurement), and supporting our customers directly. I call on my marketing background for copywriting, graphic design, video editing, and presentations, and occasionally on my fledgling programming skills to contribute to the codebase.</p>
            <p>With a diverse background spanning theatre, youth work, criminology, marketing, and more, my career choices have always prioritised creative thinking, communication, problem-solving, and continuous skill development.</p>

                            <li>Implemented various programs in <strong>C</strong> to do things like calculate the minimum number of coins needed to make a certain amount in change, compute the reading age of a piece of text, determine the winner of a plurality vs a ranked-choice election, apply different image filters to BMPs, and recover deleted files on a memory card.</li>
                            <li>Reproduced some of my C projects in <strong>Python</strong>, and implemented a new program to identify a person from a sequence of DNA.</li>
                            <li>Had way more fun that I was expecting to, using <strong>SQL</strong> to query song and movie databases and solve a crime puzzle!</li>
                            <li>Coded this CV site from scratch to practice my new <strong>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</strong> skills.</li>
                            <li>Built a web applications using <strong>Flask</strong> to allow for the &ldquo;buying&rdquo; and &ldquo;selling&rdquo; of stocks.</li>
                            <li>Crafted my final project: <a href="https://rankly.netlify.app/" target="_blank">rankly</a>. A simple web-app that allows a user to rank a list of up to 10 items. See the <a href="https://github.com/quovixi/rankly?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">README</a> for more details.</li>
