## Background

This project started life as my submission for CS50's Homepage problem set, to test my understanding of using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I've since adapted it to be my personal site with resume and list of projects.

## Projects

My bigger projects (such as [rankly](https://rankly.quovixi.com), [LinkedInspo](https://linkedinspo.quovixi.com) and [RSVPcalc](https://rsvpcalc.quovixi.com)) live on their own subdomains, but the following projects live on quovixi.com directly:

### Resume ([/resume](https://quovixi.com/resume))

A page detailing my background, experience, education and skills. 

### quonnections ([/quonnections](https://quovixi.com/quonnections))

A connecting wall style quiz.

### perfect match ([/perfect-match](https://quovixi.com/perfect-match))

A name compatibility game I used to play as a kid.
